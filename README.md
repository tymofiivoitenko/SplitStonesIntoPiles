Specification: Given an array of stone weights, split them into 2 piles with minimal weight difference

## Solution

The problem can be solved in 2 ways:
1. Recursion:
    Time Complexity = O(2^n)
2. Dynamic programming: 
    Time Complexity = O(n*sum)
    
The PileSplitter execute the fastest solution for given array based on:

    1. number of elements
    2. sum of elements in array
